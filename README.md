mostly arduino code for my home automation project

### haut-generic2 (esp)
https://easyeda.com/kirk/haut_generic2-c295f3f180a3433c981de758933fe765

* 4 pcb-s ordered
* one already built and functional
* has some more or less minor issues; it works
* 3d printed box

### haut-generic-v1 board:
https://easyeda.com/kirk/haut_generic1-Qf9rlDVd7

* never built...looked like a dead end because of arduino firmware space limitations


### getting this project to build

...I don't expect anyone else working on this :) but since I sometimes keep 3 month long pauses with this project :)
it might come handy :)

* fetch all the submodules
* install arduino eclipse
* add platforms
  http://arduino.esp8266.com/stable/package_esp8266com_index.json
  http://drazzy.com/package_drazzy.com_index.json
* set this projects libraries to a library path of arduino eclipse
* create a project in sloeber...
* remove the Blink files; and hard link an ino from the project to it
* copy libraries/k-settings.sample.h and adjust settings
* add libraries; possibly install some via sloeber as well; if I'm lazy to add them as submodules


### setup


* run mosquito mqtt https://github.com/toke/docker-mosquitto
* apt-get install mosquitto-clients
* mosquitto_sub -h demeter -v -t '#'
* make sure that ota computes hash-es
  https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/pull/2236/files#diff-7f9574f87fdcc5b8fce32df1decf313eR178
  (will be in 2.4.0, but 2.3.0 can be patched)
* startup ota server:
  docker build -t esp-ota .
  docker run -p8181:8181 -it -v $HOME/Documents/sloeber-workspace:/ws/ --rm esp-ota
  v2:
  docker run -p8181:8181 -it -v `pwd`/../:/ws/ --rm esp-ota
* and the story of GPIO16 and the removal of _PULLUP because it doesnt work with it :D
  change INPUT_PULLUP to PULLUP in DHT.cpp if GPIO16 (esp-gen1)
* initiate ota upgrade
  mosquitto_pub -h demeter -t inTopic -m U
* wiringPi: install by using checkinstall; only main lib


### compile attiny slave firmware

* create project as earlier...set attiny85...other options should be configured with sanity :D
* possibly add http://playground.arduino.cc/Linux/Udev
* possibly need standard arduino ide for bootloader burning
* flash 8Mhz fuses:
  avrdude -C/home/kirk/sdk/sloeber//arduinoPlugin/packages/ATTinyCore/hardware/avr/1.1.4/avrdude.conf  \
   -pattiny85 -carduino -P/dev/ttyACM0 -b19200 \
    -Uflash:w:/home/kirk/Documents/sloeber-workspace/pwm_slave/Release/pwm_slave.hex:i  \
    -U lfuse:w:0xE2:m	-U hfuse:w:0xDF:m


### PIR anti noise

https://www.letscontrolit.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=671&start=10
* reduce tx power; use G
```
wifi_set_phy_mode(PHY_MODE_11G);
system_phy_set_max_tpw(40);
```
  it seems to be working :)
* 220nF ceramic capacitor across pin12 und pin13 of the chip (BISS0001) 
  not yet tried


### pending improvements
* add metric to show total publish time
* move critical section from main

#### busy board next

* add analog display
* add more leds to busy_logic if possible
* add sound16 with a switch 
  * move hdr and pwr to back?
  * cover?
* add rfid reader to board plane
  * move hdr to back
* create esp8266 center board
  * rfid connector on back
  * angled 5v i2c connetor(s) ?
* small i2c screen?
* 2 row lcd screen?
* potmeter?
* hall sensor(s)
  * 1 unit = 1 hall sensor + led to show state
  * check sense distance - across board
* possibly need hdr to program pro mini
